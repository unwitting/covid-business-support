# ❤️ Support your local businesses during the pandemic

The global Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic is hitting local business incredibly hard: in the UK, the population has been advised to steer clear of any unnecessary contact or gatherings, yet businesses have not been forced to close by government.

This leaves them without the majority of their income, but unable to claim insurance.

Many businesses are coming up with novel and creative ways to keep themselves afloat during the pandemic: restaurants are offering takeaway or delivery where they didn't before, services are opening up for paid-up-front bookings to maintain some cashflow.

This site lists those businesses with information on the special measures they're taking. Use it to support them if you're unable to give them your usual business: for many of them this is an existential threat.

This website is minimal, I get it. I'm making it fast, since this is an urgent situation. It'll improve over time but what's important right now is the information. If you want to help out, see the contributing section below!

## Finally

This site is **totally unofficial** and **unaffiliated** with any government or health bodies. It's literally just a hand of support being put out by somebody who's main skills lie in making a quick website. The project was kicked off by [Jack Preston](https://twitter.com/unwttng) and they reached out for local contributors from there.

**All advice or information on this site should take a second place to current official recommendations on how to stay safe**.
